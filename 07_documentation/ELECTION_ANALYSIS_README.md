## Data Files

### **Main Analysis Datasets**

**Final post-election analysis:**
[final_post_election_analysis.csv](final_post_election_analysis.csv)
- 28 county-year observations
- All policy measures aggregated
- Includes proper 1st-2nd place margins
- **Primary dataset for analysis**

**Election margins:**
[election_margins_1st_2nd.csv](election_margins_1st_2nd.csv)
- 16 elections with proper margins calculated
- Shows 1st vs 2nd place, number of candidates
- Includes close election indicators at multiple thresholds

**Individual policies matched to DAs:**
[policies_with_incumbent_da.csv](policies_with_incumbent_da.csv)
- 1,865 policy documents
- 185 matched to incumbent DAs (9.9%)
- Raw data before aggregation

### **Supporting Datasets**

[da_tenures.csv](da_tenures.csv) - DA tenures from election data
[close_election_thresholds_comparison.csv](close_election_thresholds_comparison.csv) - Comparison of ≤5pp, ≤10pp, ≤15pp
[margin_correlations_proper.csv](margin_correlations_proper.csv) - Correlation table
[county_year_policies_matched.csv](county_year_policies_matched.csv) - County-year aggregates

## Code

### **Main Analysis Script**
[prosecutor_analysis_final.py](prosecutor_analysis_final.py)
- **Use this for replication**
- Calculates proper 1st-2nd place margins
- Matches policies to incumbent DAs
- Runs all statistical tests
- Generates all output files

### **Earlier Versions**
[prosecutor_analysis_improved.py](prosecutor_analysis_improved.py) - Used winner vote % (incorrect for multi-candidate)
[prosecutor_analysis.py](prosecutor_analysis.py) - Original version

## Key Findings Summary

### **1. Close Elections (≤15pp margin) → +31.2pp More Progressive**
- Close: 50.7% progressive policies
- Not close: 19.5% progressive policies
- **p = 0.010** (highly significant)

### **2. Very Close Elections (≤5pp margin) → +24.4pp More Progressive**
- Close: 55.0% progressive
- Not close: 30.6% progressive  
- **p = 0.036** (significant)

### **3. Multi-Candidate Races Are More Progressive**
- 3+ candidates: 49.6% progressive
- 2 candidates: 39.0% progressive

### **4. Extremely Close Races Have Dramatic Effects**
- **LA 2020 (Gascón)**: 0.03pp margin → 60.5% progressive in Year 1
- **SF 2019 (Boudin)**: 4.63pp margin → 63.6% progressive

### **5. Specific Progressive Policies After Close Elections**
- Racial justice emphasis: **13x higher**
- Bail reform: **5x higher**
- Lenient sentencing: **1.7x higher**

## Statistical Results

**Correlation: Margin ↔ Ideology**
- r = -0.50 (p = 0.009**)

**Regression: Progressive % = 44.4 - 0.24 × Margin**
- Each 1pp increase in margin → 0.24pp decrease in progressive policies

**Sample:**
- 28 county-year observations
- 185 policy documents
- 16 elections across 11 counties

## Important Methodological Note

### **Why Proper Margins Matter**

**❌ WRONG:** "Close election = winner got ≤55%"
- Fails for multi-candidate races
- Boudin won with 35.71% (seems not close)
- But beat 2nd place by only 4.63pp (actually very close!)

**✅ RIGHT:** "Close election = 1st-2nd margin ≤15pp"
- Works for any number of candidates
- Correctly identifies competitive races
- What matters: how hard you had to fight to win

**Real examples:**
- Gascón: 53.53% vs 53.50% = **0.03pp margin** → EXTREMELY close
- Boudin: 35.71% vs 31.08% = **4.63pp margin** → Very close
- Jenkins (post-recall): 46.00% vs 37.30% = **8.70pp margin** → Moderately close

## Questions Answered

1. **How often do prosecutors switch ideology?**
   - 44.5% of county-years show ideological changes
   - But most changes happen without DA turnover
   - Only 9 switches FROM progressive (stable)

2. **Do close elections predict progressive policies?**
   - **YES:** +31.2pp more progressive after close elections
   - Effect is large and statistically significant
   - Robust across multiple measures

3. **What about multi-candidate races?**
   - All 3 multi-candidate races were close
   - Produced 49.6% progressive policies
   - Must use proper margins, not vote %

4. **Which specific policies change?**
   - Racial justice emphasis (13x)
   - Bail reform (5x)
   - Sentencing leniency (1.7x)
   - Reduced incarceration at entry (1.6x)
