- Coincided with George Floyd protests
- **Strongest predictor of progressive ideology** (92% of high-RJ docs are progressive)

### 3. **Geographic Clusters**
- **Progressive**: Sacramento (78%), Yolo (56%), San Diego (50%)
- **Traditional**: Stanislaus (-34%), Placer (-21%)
- Bay Area more progressive but high internal variation

### 4. **Gascón Transformation (LA County)**
- Progressive docs: 35% → 55% (+20pp)
- Ideology score: +0.31 → +1.04 (+238%)
- **Large effect size**: Cohen's d = 0.75 (p<0.001)

### 5. **Policy Focus Shifts**
- **Emerging**: Racial justice (+14pp), diversion (+4pp), bail (+3pp)
- **Declining**: Administrative (-13pp), case law (-6pp)
- Support for alternatives: 10% → 21% (+112%)

### 6. **Extensive > Intensive Margin**
- Extensive margin (charging) leniency: 34%
- Intensive margin (sentencing) leniency: 23%
- **Focus on preventing entry** vs reducing severity

## Statistical Tests Performed

| Analysis | Test | Result | Interpretation |
|----------|------|--------|----------------|
| Temporal trend | Linear regression | p=0.003, R²=0.52 | **Highly significant** upward trend |
| Bay Area difference | Independent t-test | p=0.14 | Not significant (but directional) |
| RJ × Progressive | Chi-square | χ²=421, p<0.001 | **Extremely significant** association |
| Gascón impact | Independent t-test | p<0.001, d=0.75 | **Large effect**, highly significant |

## Research Implications

### Progressive Prosecutor Measurement
- Clear operational definition based on actual policies (not campaign rhetoric or case outcomes)
- Temporal and geographic variation documented — use `ideology_score` as continuous DV in regressions
- Multiple measures available: binary classification, continuous score, specific policy positions
- Figure 1 (temporal evolution) and Figure 5 (ideology heatmap) provide county-year variation

### Racial Justice as Policy Signal
- Strong empirical link between RJ emphasis and progressive orientation (92% of high-RJ docs are progressive)
- 2020 as critical juncture — 30pp surge coinciding with George Floyd protests
- Geographic variation in adoption creates natural comparison groups
- Figure 3 shows RJ trends and county leaders; useful for baseline policy comparisons

### DA Elections and Accountability
- Gascón case provides quasi-experimental evidence of leadership effects (d=0.75, p<0.001)
- Large, statistically significant effects suggest electoral accountability is meaningful
- Close elections data enables regression discontinuity designs

### Policy Strategy Patterns
- Extensive margin (charging) reforms more common than intensive margin (sentencing) reforms
- RJ framing associated with broader reform adoption
- Geographic clustering suggests policy diffusion patterns across counties
- Figure 2 shows actual county-level policy variation — useful as baseline for media coverage comparisons

### Grant and Funding Applications
- Clear evidence of progressive prosecutor movement with statistical backing
- Geographic and temporal variation justifies county-level causal designs
- RJ emergence supports racial justice framing for criminal justice funders

## Important Caveats

1. **Policy ≠ Practice**: Documents show stated policies, not necessarily implementation
2. **Selection bias**: Publicly available documents may not represent all policies
3. **Temporal data**: Recent years (2023-2024) have fewer documents
4. **Causality**: Correlational evidence; causal claims require additional evidence
5. **County variation**: Some counties have <15 documents

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-up Analyses

1. **Outcome linkage**: Connect policies to actual prosecution/incarceration data
2. **Media content analysis**: Compare policy reality to coverage
3. **Regression discontinuity**: Analyze close DA elections
4. **Network analysis**: Track policy diffusion across counties
5. **Victim perspective**: Include victim advocacy positions

### Additional Data Needs

- Prosecution rates, case outcomes, sentence lengths
- Budget and staffing data
- Public opinion polls by county
- Victim advocacy group statements
- Implementation/compliance data
